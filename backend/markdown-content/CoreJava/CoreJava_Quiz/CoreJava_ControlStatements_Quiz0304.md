### Question: Which statement is the simplest form of decision-making, executing a block of code only if a given condition evaluates to true?

- A) if...else
- B) switch
- C) if
- D) do-while
  **Answer:** C

### Question: Which loop structure is ideal for scenarios where the number of iterations is known beforehand?

- A) do-while loop
- B) while loop
- C) for loop
- D) for-each loop
  **Answer:** C

### Question: What is the immediate effect of a break statement when encountered inside a loop or switch block?

- A) It skips the current iteration and moves to the next.
- B) It terminates the current loop or switch block prematurely.
- C) It restarts the loop from the beginning.
- D) It causes an error in the program.
  **Answer:** B

### Question: When is an if...else-if ladder typically used in Java programming?

- A) When there is only one condition to evaluate.
- B) When a task should only be performed under a single specific condition.
- C) When there are multiple conditions to evaluate sequentially.
- D) When decisions are dependent on other decisions.
  **Answer:** C

### Question: Which characteristic accurately describes a while loop in Java?

- A) It guarantees that the block of code runs at least once.
- B) It evaluates the condition before executing the loop body.
- C) It is ideal for scenarios where the number of iterations is known beforehand.
- D) It eliminates the need for an index variable.
  **Answer:** B

### Question: Which control statement serves as a cleaner alternative to lengthy if-else-if ladders, especially when evaluating a single variable against multiple constant values?

- A) nested if...else statement
- B) do-while loop
- C) switch statement
- D) for-each loop
  **Answer:** C

### Question: According to the notes, which data types are supported by the switch statement in Java (since Java 7)?

- A) Only int
- B) int, char, and String
- C) Any primitive data type
- D) boolean and double
  **Answer:** B

### Question: What is the fundamental difference in effect between the break and continue statements within a loop?

- A) break restarts the loop, while continue exits it.
- B) break is used in switch only, while continue is used in loops only.
- C) break exits the loop completely, while continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next.
- D) break is for error handling, while continue is for normal flow.
  **Answer:** C

### Question: In a scenario where user input needs to be validated, and the validation code must execute at least once before potentially looping for re-entry, which loop structure is most appropriate?

- A) for loop
- B) while loop
- C) do-while loop
- D) for-each loop
  **Answer:** C

### Question: Which of the following statements about the switch statement in Java is NOT true?

- A) It requires a break statement to exit after a matching case.
- B) Its default case is optional.
- C) It can use variables or ranges in case labels.
- D) It compares the value of a variable against defined constant case labels.
  **Answer:** C

### Question: A programmer is writing a loop to process a list of numbers, but needs to skip over certain values (e.g., multiples of 3 or 5) without stopping the loop entirely. Which jump statement should be used to achieve this?

- A) break
- B) return
- C) continue
- D) exit
  **Answer:** C

### Question: When dealing with many constant cases, how does the performance of a switch statement generally compare to an if-else-if ladder?

- A) switch is generally slower.
- B) if-else-if is generally faster.
- C) switch is generally faster.
- D) Their performance is always identical.
  **Answer:** C

- A) Single for loop
- B) if-else statements
- C) nested loops
- D) do-while loops with break
  **Answer:** C
