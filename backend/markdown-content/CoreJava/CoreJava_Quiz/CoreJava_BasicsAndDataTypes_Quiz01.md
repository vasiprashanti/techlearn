### Question: When a reference variable is passed as an argument to a method, what is copied, and what is the potential implication of changes made inside the method?

- A) The actual object is copied; changes inside the method cannot affect the original object.
- B) The actual object is copied; changes inside the method always affect the original object.
- C) The reference (address) is copied; changes made inside the method can affect the original object.
- D) The reference (address) is copied; changes made inside the method cannot affect the original object.
  **Answer:** C

### Question: Java is described as a "strongly typed" and "statically typed" language. What does this imply about variable declaration and type-checking?

- A) Variables can change their data type during runtime, and type-checking occurs at runtime.
- B) Each variable must be declared with a data type, and type-checking is enforced at compile time.
- C) Data types are inferred by the compiler, and no explicit declaration is needed.
- D) Type errors are ignored, leading to more flexible code.
  **Answer:** B

### Question: Why does Java provide "wrapper classes" like Integer, Double, and Boolean for primitive types?

- A) To reduce memory usage of primitive types.
- B) To allow primitive types to be treated as objects, especially in contexts like collections.
- C) To make primitive types mutable.
- D) To convert primitive types to reference types automatically at compile time.
  **Answer:** B
