a) They can store multiple values of different data types under a single variable name.

### Question: What is a fundamental characteristic of arrays in Java?

- A) They can store multiple values of different data types under a single variable name.
- B) Their length can be resized dynamically after declaration.
- C) All elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- D) They are primarily used for managing tasks in daily life without any specific data type.
  **Answer:** C

a) Static initialization defines the size first and inserts values later, while dynamic provides values during declaration.

### Question: In Java, what is the primary difference between static and dynamic array initialization?

- A) Static initialization defines the size first and inserts values later, while dynamic provides values during declaration.
- B) Static initialization provides values during the declaration itself, while dynamic defines the size first and inserts values later.
- C) Static arrays are used for primitive types, and dynamic arrays are used for object types.
- D) Static arrays require a catalog, while dynamic arrays do not.
  **Answer:** B

a) 1.

### Question: What index does the first element of a Java array typically have?

- A) 1
- B) -1
- C) 0
- D) Varies depending on the array type
  **Answer:** C

a) .size().

### Question: Which built-in property is used to determine the number of elements in a Java array?

- A) .size()
- B) .count()
- C) .length
- D) .capacity()
  **Answer:** C

a) Because it sorts elements by creating "bubbles" of sorted data.

### Question: Why is the sorting algorithm described as "Bubble Sort"?

- A) Because it sorts elements by creating "bubbles" of sorted data.
- B) Because it compares elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, causing larger elements to "bubble" to the end of the list.
- C) Because it randomly sorts elements, similar to bubbles in a liquid.
- D) Because it involves placing elements into "buckets" or "bubbles".
  **Answer:** B

a) It divides the array into halves until the element is found.

### Question: What is the fundamental approach of Linear Search when looking for an element in an array?

- A) It divides the array into halves until the element is found.
- B) It jumps to random positions in the array until the element is found.
- C) It checks each element one by one, starting from the beginning, until the desired element is found or the end of the array is reached.
- D) It requires the array to be sorted first to efficiently find the element.
  **Answer:** C

a) It is complex to implement.

### Question: Which of the following is a disadvantage of using Linear Search for large datasets?

- A) It is complex to implement.
- B) It requires the array to be sorted beforehand.
- C) It is slow because it may scan the entire array even if the element is near the end or not present.
- D) It only works with numeric data types.
  **Answer:** C

a) Packing a fixed lunchbox with 5 known items.

### Question: Which real-life analogy best describes "dynamic initialization" of an array?

- A) Packing a fixed lunchbox with 5 known items.
- B) Designing a building plan where Java needs to allocate memory separately.
- C) Setting 5 chairs for a party without knowing who will attend, then assigning seats as people arrive.
- D) Naming a pet, where the syntax flexibility doesn't change the meaning.
  **Answer:** C

a) Bubble Sort.

### Question: The analogy of searching for a specific book on a messy shelf by picking each book and reading its title from left to right, then stopping if found or giving up if the end is reached, illustrates which concept?

- A) Bubble Sort
- B) Static Initialization
- C) Linear Search
- D) Using the .length attribute
  **Answer:** C

a) Only int[] ar; is valid Java syntax.

### Question: According to the notes, regarding the placement of brackets in Java array declarations (e.g., int ar[]; or int[] ar;), what is true?

- A) Only int[] ar; is valid Java syntax.
- B) Only int ar[]; is valid Java syntax.
- C) Both declarations are valid and have the same meaning.
- D) The placement of brackets determines if the array is statically or dynamically initialized.
  **Answer:** C
